  abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.}

Accumulation of such sequences accounts for at least 40\% of our genome today. These integrating elements are also of interest as gene-delivery vectors for human gene therapy. Here we present a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of integration targeting by HIV, MLV, ASLV, SFV, L1, SB, and AAV. We used a mathematical method which allowed annotation of each base pair in the human genome for its likelihood of hosting an integration event by each type of element, taking advantage of more than 200 types of genomic annotation. This bioinformatic resource documents a wealth of new associations between genomic features and integration targeting. The study also revealed that the length of genomic intervals analyzed strongly affected the conclusions drawn\textemdash thus, answering the question ``What genomic features affect integration?'' requires carefully specifying the length scale of interest.},

  abstract = {Motivation: The relative abundance of retroviral insertions in a host genome is important in understanding the persistence and pathogenesis of both natural retroviral infections and retroviral gene therapy vectors. It could be estimated from a sample of cells if only the host genomic sites of retroviral insertions could be directly counted. When host genomic DNA is randomly broken via sonication and then amplified, amplicons of varying lengths are produced. The number of unique lengths of amplicons of an insertion site tends to increase according to its abundance, providing a basis for estimating relative abundance. However, as abundance increases amplicons of the same length arise by chance leading to a non-linear relation between the number of unique lengths and relative abundance. The difficulty in calibrating this relation is compounded by sample-specific variations in the relative frequencies of clones of each length.Results: A likelihood function is proposed for the discrete lengths observed in each of a collection of insertion sites and is maximized with a hybrid expectation\textendash maximization algorithm. Patient data illustrate the method and simulations show that relative abundance can be estimated with little bias, but that variation in highly abundant sites can be large. In replicated patient samples, variation exceeds what the model implies\textemdash requiring adjustment as in Efron (2004) or using jackknife standard errors. Consequently, it is advantageous to collect replicate samples to strengthen inferences about relative abundance.Availability: An R package implements the algorithm described here.

Application to several sets of experimentally determined HIV integration sites demonstrates the software.

Here, we describe tools for data analysis and visualization that take as input integration site data from our INSPIIRED pipeline. Paired-end sequencing allows inference of the numbers of transduced cells as well as the distributions of integration sites in target genomes. We present interactive heatmaps that allow comparison of distributions of integration sites to genomic features and that support numerous user-defined statistical tests. To summarize integration site data from human gene therapy samples, we developed a reproducible report format that catalogs sample population structure, longitudinal dynamics, and integration frequency near cancer-associated genes. We also introduce a novel summary statistic, the UC50 (unique cell progenitors contributing the most expanded 50\% of progeny cell clones), which provides a single number summarizing possible clonal expansion. Using these tools, we characterize ongoing longitudinal characterization of a patient from the first trial to treat severe combined immunodeficiency-X1 (SCID-X1), showing successful reconstitution for 15 years accompanied by persistence of a cell clone with an~integration site near the cancer-associated gene CCND2.

Here we analyze the forces directing the accumulation of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) by comparing de novo HERV integration targeting with the distribution of fixed HERV elements in the human genome. All known genomic HERVs are inactive due to mutation, but we were able to study integration targeting using a reconstituted consensus HERV-K (designated HERV-KCon). We found that HERV-KCon integrated preferentially in transcription units, in gene-rich regions, and near features associated with active transcription units and associated regulatory regions. In contrast, genomic HERV-K proviruses are found preferentially outside transcription units. The minority of genomic HERVKs present inside transcription units are in opposite transcriptional orientation relative to the host gene, the orientation predicted to be minimally disruptive to host mRNA synthesis, but de novo HERV-KCon integration within transcription units showed no orientation bias. We also found that the youngest HERV-K elements in the human genome showed a distribution intermediate between de novo HERV-KCon integration sites and older fixed HERV-Ks. These findings indicate that accumulation of HERVs in the human germline is a two-step process: integration targeting biases direct initial accumulation, then purifying selection leads to loss of proviruses disrupting gene function.},

A potent form of insertional mutagenesis involves integration of retroviral DNA produced by reverse transcription, a required step in the replication of retroviruses. In recent years retroviral replication has been adapted to allow new gene addition by retroviral vectors. Early in the history of retrovirus research, analysis of insertional mutagenesis in laboratory animals was found at times to result in transformation, leading to the discovery of cellular proto-oncogenes. In-depth analysis of the genetic consequences showed that integration of retroviral DNA could alter the gene activity in a variety of ways. Mechanisms of retroviral insertional mutagenesis in humans are much less well documented. However, recent work from the gene therapy and HIV fields now specify four genetic mechanisms of retroviral insertional mutagenesis in humans: (1) gene activation by integration of an enhancer sequence encoded in a retroviral vector (enhancer insertion), (2) gene activation by promoter insertion, (3) gene inactivation by insertional disruption, and (4) gene activation by mRNA 3{${'}$} end substitution. In each example, integration in patients was associated with clonal expansion or frank transformation.},

  abstract = {The X-linked disorder Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS), characterized by thrombocytopenia, eczema, recurrent infections, autoimmunity and cancer, is typically treated with allogeneic transplantation. Somatic gene therapy (GT) using autologous CD34+ cells is a promising treatment alternative for high-risk patients lacking matched allogeneic donors, as it avoids graft versus host disease. GT using a {$\gamma$}-retroviral vector with intact viral enhancers was efficacious but had a high rate of leukemia due to insertional oncogenesis. We report here preliminary results of 4 WAS patients who underwent GT using a self-inactivating lentiviral (SIN-LV) vector, in which viral enhancers have been deleted and the human WAS cDNA is controlled by a 1.6kB fragment of the human WAS promoter (w1.6\_hWASP\_WPRE SIN-LV). WASP expression per cell induced by this vector was lower than in normal cells when examined in murine models and human trials. We hypothesized that the SIN-LV would readily correct immune abnormalities due to selective advantage for WAS protein (WASP) expressing T cells whereas correction of myeloid and platelet abnormalities would require high vector copy number (VCN) in the infused cells.Patients with severe WAS (clinical scores 3-5) were enrolled at a median age of 32 months (17 months-8 years). Patients 1 and 3 had detectable but low WASP expression. Patients 2 and 4 carried mutations that abrogated WASP expression but had evidence of somatic reversion in T and/or NK cells. CliniMACS purified CD34+ mobilized peripheral blood or bone marrow cells were transduced with the vector and infused after busulfan (12-15mg/kg) and fludarabine (120mg/m2) conditioning. CD34+ cell doses ranged from 6.3-24.91 x 106 cells/kg. VCN of the infused cells was variable (3.37, 1.34, 0.54, 1.01 copies/cell). Busulfan exposure was myeloablative or near-myeloablative in patients 1, 3, and 4 (81.2, 77.2, 84.5 mg*h/L) and submyeloablative in patient 2 (48.8 mg*h/L).All patients are alive with median follow-up of 13.5 months (9-24 months). All patients had improvement in eczema, remain platelet transfusion independent and have had no severe bleeding events. WASP expression in T cells was increased post-GT over baseline. Selective advantage for WASP expressing T cells was apparent in patients 1, 2 and 4, who had higher VCN in T cells at 6 months post-GT (0.93-2.21) than in B (0.48-1.7) or myeloid (0.13-0.89) cells. The presence of revertants in patients 2 and 4 did not appear to interfere with T cell reconstitution. In contrast patient 3 who had the highest WASP expression at baseline and the lowest VCN of infused cells (0.5 copies/cell), had the lowest VCN in T cells at 8 months (0.1 copies/cell). Defective T cell proliferation in response to anti-CD3 stimulation, characteristic of WAS, was improved post-GT. Next generation sequencing of T cell receptors in sorted na\"ive, memory and regulatory T cells revealed profound abnormalities of diversity, decreased entropy and marked clonal expansions pre-GT; most of these improved at 6 months post-GT. Cytoskeletal function in myeloid cells was highly abnormal pre-GT, as shown by absence of podosome formation in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (0-1\% vs. 61\% in controls). Podosome formation at 6 months post GT was improved but subnormal (4-40\%). Only patient 1, who received the highest cell dose, the highest VCN, and myeloablative busulfan exposure had robust platelet reconstitution (pre-GT 24 versus 110 x 109/L 6 months post-GT) and high level gene marking in myeloid cells 0.89 copies/cell. At the same timepoint, patients 2, 3 and 4 had platelet counts of 20-30 x 109/L and correspondingly lower VCN in myeloid cells (0.13-0.27 copies/cell).No severe adverse events related to GT have occurred to date, with relatively short follow-up. Integration site analysis of sorted cells showed highly polyclonal reconstitution, with distributions of integration acceptor sites as expected for the lentiviral vector backbone. In summary, GT using a SIN-LV that induces expression of WASP at levels below wild type improved the clinical and laboratory manifestations of WAS, with better reconstitution in patients receiving cells with high VCN.Off Label Use: Off-label use of CliniMACS purified CD34+ cells.},

  abstract = {Cancer immunotherapy based on genetically redirecting T cells has been used successfully to treat B cell malignancies1-3. In this strategy, the T cell genome is modified by integration of viral vectors or transposons encoding chimaeric antigen receptors (CARs) that direct tumour cell killing. However, this approach is often limited by the extent of expansion and persistence of CAR T cells4,5. Here we report mechanistic insights from studies of a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia treated with CAR T cells targeting the CD19 protein. Following infusion of CAR T cells, anti-tumour activity was evident in the peripheral blood, lymph nodes and bone marrow; this activity was accompanied by complete remission. Unexpectedly, at the peak of the response, 94\% of CAR T cells originated from a single clone in which lentiviral vector-mediated insertion of the CAR transgene disrupted the methylcytosine dioxygenase TET2 gene. Further analysis revealed a hypomorphic mutation in this patient's second TET2 allele. TET2-disrupted CAR T cells exhibited an epigenetic profile consistent with altered T cell differentiation and, at the peak of expansion, displayed a central memory phenotype. Experimental knockdown of TET2 recapitulated the potency-enhancing effect of TET2 dysfunction in this patient's CAR T cells. These findings suggest that the progeny of a single CAR T cell induced leukaemia remission and that TET2 modification may be useful for improving immunotherapies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In previous clinical trials involving children with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1), a Moloney murine leukemia virus-based {$\gamma$}-retrovirus vector expressing interleukin-2 receptor {$\gamma$}-chain ({$\gamma$}c) complementary DNA successfully restored immunity in most patients but resulted in vector-induced leukemia through enhancer-mediated mutagenesis in 25\% of patients. We assessed the efficacy and safety of a self-inactivating retrovirus for the treatment of SCID-X1. METHODS: We enrolled nine boys with SCID-X1 in parallel trials in Europe and the United States to evaluate treatment with a self-inactivating (SIN) {$\gamma$}-retrovirus vector containing deletions in viral enhancer sequences expressing {$\gamma$}c (SIN-{$\gamma$}c). RESULTS: All patients received bone marrow-derived CD34+ cells transduced with the SIN-{$\gamma$}c vector, without preparative conditioning. After 12.1 to 38.7 months of follow-up, eight of the nine children were still alive. One patient died from an overwhelming adenoviral infection before reconstitution with genetically modified T cells. Of the remaining eight patients, seven had recovery of peripheral-blood T cells that were functional and led to resolution of infections. The patients remained healthy thereafter. The kinetics of CD3+ T-cell recovery was not significantly different from that observed in previous trials. Assessment of insertion sites in peripheral blood from patients in the current trial as compared with those in previous trials revealed significantly less clustering of insertion sites within LMO2, MECOM, and other lymphoid proto-oncogenes in our patients. CONCLUSIONS: This modified {$\gamma$}-retrovirus vector was found to retain efficacy in the treatment of SCID-X1. The long-term effect of this therapy on leukemogenesis remains unknown.

Partially HLA antigen\textendash matched allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is often curative but is associated with significant comorbidity.To assess the outcomes and safety of autologous HSC gene therapy in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.Gene-corrected autologous HSCs were infused in 7 consecutive patients with severe Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome lacking HLA antigen\textendash matched related or unrelated HSC donors (age range, 0.8-15.5 years; mean, 7 years) following myeloablative conditioning. Patients were enrolled in France and England and treated between December 2010 and January 2014. Follow-up of patients in this intermediate analysis ranged from 9 to 42 months.A single infusion of gene-modified CD34+ cells with an advanced lentiviral vector.Primary outcomes were improvement at 24 months in eczema, frequency and severity of infections, bleeding tendency, and autoimmunity and reduction in disease-related days of hospitalization. Secondary outcomes were improvement in immunological and hematological characteristics and evidence of safety through vector integration analysis.Six of the 7 patients were alive at the time of last follow-up (mean and median follow-up, 28 months and 27 months, respectively) and showed sustained clinical benefit. One patient died 7 months after treatment of preexisting drug-resistant herpes virus infection. Eczema and susceptibility to infections resolved in all 6 patients. Autoimmunity improved in 5 of 5 patients. No severe bleeding episodes were recorded after treatment, and at last follow-up, all 6 surviving patients were free of blood product support and thrombopoietic agonists. Hospitalization days were reduced from a median of 25 days during the 2 years before treatment to a median of 0 days during the 2 years after treatment. All 6 surviving patients exhibited high-level, stable engraftment of functionally corrected lymphoid cells. The degree of myeloid cell engraftment and of platelet reconstitution correlated with the dose of gene-corrected cells administered. No evidence of vector-related toxicity was observed clinically or by molecular analysis.This study demonstrated the feasibility of the use of gene therapy in patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Controlled trials with larger numbers of patients are necessary to assess long-term outcomes and safety.},

NCT02234934 and NCT01855685). The primary objectives were to assess the safety and evaluate the efficacy and stability of biochemical and functional reconstitution in the progeny of engrafted cells at 12\,months. The secondary objectives included the evaluation of augmented immunity against bacterial and fungal infection, as well as assessment of hematopoietic stem cell transduction and engraftment. Two enrolled patients died within 3\,months of treatment from pre-existing comorbidities. At 12\,months, six of the seven surviving patients demonstrated stable vector copy numbers (0.4\textendash 1.8 copies per neutrophil) and the persistence of 16\textendash 46\% oxidase-positive neutrophils. There was no molecular evidence of either clonal dysregulation or transgene silencing. Surviving patients have had no new CGD-related infections, and six have been able to discontinue CGD-related antibiotic prophylaxis. The primary objective was met in six of the nine patients at 12\,months follow-up, suggesting that autologous gene therapy is a promising approach for CGD patients.},

Administration of AAV8 or AAV9 vectors expressing canine factor VIII (AAV-cFVIII) corrected the FVIII deficiency to 1.9\textendash 11.3\% of normal FVIII levels. In two of nine dogs, levels of FVIII activity increased gradually starting about 4 years after treatment. None of the dogs showed evidence of tumors or altered liver function. Analysis of integration sites in liver samples from six treated dogs identified 1,741 unique AAV integration events in genomic DNA and expanded cell clones in five dogs, with 44\% of the integrations near genes involved in cell growth. All recovered integrated vectors were partially deleted and/or rearranged. Our data suggest that the increase in FVIII protein expression in two dogs may have been due to clonal expansion of cells harboring integrated vectors. These results support the clinical development of liver-directed AAV gene therapy for hemophilia A, while emphasizing the importance of long-term monitoring for potential genotoxicity.},

CART19 harbor an engineered receptor, which is delivered through lentiviral vector integration, thereby marking cell lineages and modifying the cellular genome by insertional mutagenesis. We recently reported that vector integration within the host TET2 gene was associated with CLL remission. Here, we investigated clonal population structure and therapeutic outcomes in another 39 patients by high-throughput sequencing of vector-integration sites. Genes at integration sites enriched in responders were commonly found in cell-signaling and chromatin modification pathways, suggesting that insertional mutagenesis in these genes promoted therapeutic T cell proliferation. We also developed a multivariate model based on integration-site distributions and found that data from preinfusion products forecasted response in CLL successfully in discovery and validation cohorts and, in day 28 samples, reported responders to CLL therapy with high accuracy. These data clarify how insertional mutagenesis can modulate cell proliferation in CART19 therapy and how data on integration-site distributions can be linked to treatment outcomes.},

We report that libraries for nanopore sequencing of ssDNA can be conveniently created without second-strand synthesis using a transposase-based protocol. We show for bacteriophage M13 ssDNA that the MuA transposase has unexpected residual activity on ssDNA, explained in part by transposase action on transient double-stranded hairpins. In case of AAV, library creation is additionally aided by genome hybridization. We demonstrate the power of direct sequencing combined with nanopore long reads by characterizing AAV vector transgenes. Sequencing yielded reads up to full genome length, including GC-rich inverted terminal repeats. Unlike short-read techniques, single reads covered genome-genome and genome-contaminant fusions and other recombination events, whilst additionally providing information on epigenetic methylation. Single-nucleotide variants across the transgene cassette were revealed and secondary genome packaging signals were readily identified. Moreover, comparison of sequence abundance with quantitative polymerase chain reaction results demonstrated the technique's future potential for quantification of DNA impurities in AAV vector stocks. The findings promote direct nanopore sequencing as a fast and versatile platform for ssDNA characterization, such as AAV ssDNA in research and clinical settings.},

Tracking the distributions of integration sites is important to characterize populations of transduced cells and to monitor potential outgrow of pathogenic cell clones. Here, we describe a pipeline for quantitative analysis of integration site distributions named INSPIIRED (integration site pipeline for paired-end reads). We describe optimized biochemical steps for site isolation using Illumina paired-end sequencing, including new technology for suppressing recovery of unwanted contaminants, then software for alignment, quality control, and management of integration site sequences. During library preparation, DNAs are broken by sonication, so that after ligation-mediated PCR the number of ligation junction sites can be used to infer abundance of gene-modified cells. We generated integration sites of known positions in~silico, and we describe optimization of sample processing parameters refined by comparison to truth. We also present a novel graph-theory-based method for quantifying integration sites in repeated sequences, and we characterize the consequences using synthetic and experimental data. In an accompanying paper, we describe an additional set of statistical tools for data analysis and visualization. Software is available at https://github.com/BushmanLab/INSPIIRED.},

  abstract = {In gene therapy with human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), each gene-corrected cell and its progeny are marked in a unique way by the integrating vector. This feature enables lineages to be tracked by sampling blood cells and using DNA sequencing to identify the vector integration sites. Here, we studied 5 cell lineages (granulocytes, monocytes, T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells) in patients having undergone HSPC gene therapy for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome or {$\beta$} hemoglobinopathies. We found that the estimated minimum number of active, repopulating HSPCs (which ranged from 2000 to 50\,000) was correlated with the number of HSPCs per kilogram infused. We sought to quantify the lineage output and dynamics of gene-modified clones; this is usually challenging because of sparse sampling of the various cell types during the analytical procedure, contamination during cell isolation, and different levels of vector marking in the various lineages. We therefore measured the residual contamination and corrected our statistical models accordingly to provide a rigorous analysis of the HSPC lineage output. A cluster analysis of the HSPC lineage output highlighted the existence of several stable, distinct differentiation programs, including myeloid-dominant, lymphoid-dominant, and balanced cell subsets. Our study evidenced the heterogeneous nature of the cell lineage output from HSPCs and provided methods for analyzing these complex data.},
